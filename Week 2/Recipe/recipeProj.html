        <h4>
                <p>Matcha, a special type of green tea, has a fascinating history that began in China during the Tang Dynasty. In the late 12th century, a Buddhist monk named Eisai introduced matcha to Japan, where it became popular for its ability to keep the mind focused during meditation. Over the years, matcha became an essential part of Japanese culture and tradition, especially in the tea ceremony. Its unique flavor, bright green color, and health benefits made it beloved worldwide, symbolizing harmony and mindfulness.</p>
